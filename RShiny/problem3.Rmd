In a detection experiment, a person is presented with signal and noise trials and asked if he or she recognizes the signal:
           response
   trial    yes  no
     noise   89 361
     signal 330 120
A measure of sensitivity is dâ€², which is defined within signal detection theory (SDT) as the difference between the means of two internal distributions (signal and noise distribution).

```{r}
trial <- c('noise','signal')
yes <- c(89, 330)
no <- c(361, 120)

dat <- data.frame(trial, yes, no)

p_hit <- 330 / (330 + 120)
p_fa <- 89 / (89 + 361)
# difference between the means of two internal distributions
d_prime <- qnorm(p_hit) - qnorm(p_fa)
```
